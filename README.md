# ytdl-script
A small bash script to simplify and prettify the process of locally downloading the youtube videos my bad student accomodation wifi can't handle.

- Simply add the download path you want to the `folder` variable and it's good to go
- The default download value is `18` but feel free to change it to your desired quality
